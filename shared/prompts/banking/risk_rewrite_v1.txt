{
  "rewritten_text": "...",
  "risk_level": "LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH",
  "flags": ["..."],
  "disclaimer_added": true|false,
  "explanation": "1-3 short bullets explaining what changed and why"
}

High-risk examples:
- "guaranteed returns", "will outperform", "you should buy", "best investment", "safe profit"
